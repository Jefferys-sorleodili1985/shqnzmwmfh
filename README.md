Duuude, just finished Marching Powder and I'm like... are prisons really like that? 😂 I mean, seriously, that was a wild ride. I don’t even know how to process what I saw. Who’d have thought about a prison with tours and... wait, let's not even start with the cocaine stuff. My mind's blown. 

You know, I actually started to think if I should download the movie or maybe just stream it coz, like, I wanted to watch the movie without interruptions. The whole plot twists just kinda hit me like whoaaa. Paul doing his whole entrepreneur thing inside—I'm just shaking my head, laughing. Imagine running a side hustle in prison. Next-level stuff, right?

And the way Thomas McFadden was just tryna survive? It’s insane how he turned the whole crappy situation into some... I dunno, some weird opportunity. There's this part where I'm like, “wait, is this for real?” But then again, I guess truth is stranger than fiction, eh? 

> I seriously need to know what these guys were thinking when they were writing this. Probably imagining people’s jaws dropping every five minutes, and yeah, mine totally did. 😆 

Yo, remember when I was like, trying to watch it and my internet just... went and died? Gah, I can't believe it. But it’s one of those movies where, even if you miss a bit, you’re still hooked. Gotta give it to the filmmakers for keeping it intense. Moody lighting and all. It almost felt like I was there. 😅

Sometimes I wonder if prison stories are just so messed up they're fascinating? Like some dark little corner of the world people just can't stop peeking into. Anyway, wacky as it was, I’m so glad I didn’t wait to see it.

And, hey, let's just say this is gonna be fresh in my head for a while. Catch ya later!
